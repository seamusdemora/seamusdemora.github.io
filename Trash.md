## trash

Copied from a [Gist by dabrahams](https://gist.github.com/dabrahams/14fedc316441c350b382528ea64bc09c). It simply gives you a command-line alternative to `rm`, but instead of a permanent deletion, it moves the file(s) to the `Trash`. 

The [code is here](https://github.com/seamusdemora/seamusdemora.github.io/blob/master/src/trash). You can install it in `usr/local/bin`, & afterwards `sudo chmod a+rx trash`.
