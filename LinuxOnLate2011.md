## Installation Log & Notes

Following is a record of an Ubuntu installation on a late-2011 Macbook Pro. This is a "dual boot" installation - Ubuntu 20.04 alongside macOS High Sierra.



### 1. Let's see what we have on our 2TB SSD:

```bash
$ diskutil list
/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk0
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         753.0 GB   disk0s2
   3:       Microsoft Basic Data OTHEROS                 1.2 TB     disk0s3

/dev/disk1 (synthesized):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +753.0 GB   disk1
                                 Physical Store disk0s2
   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            371.8 GB   disk1s1
   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 40.1 MB    disk1s2
   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                1.0 GB     disk1s3
   4:                APFS Volume VM                      8.6 GB     disk1s4


```



### 2. The "guide" for this installation: 
During this effort, we will use @japhwil's *recipe* for dual-boot installation of Ubuntu on a Mac as a guide. This *recipe* is documented in these answers: [Install Ubuntu 20.04 on Mac mini 2018 w/ Catalina](https://askubuntu.com/a/1245535/831935), and [In response to my question](https://askubuntu.com/a/1246811/831935) 
### 3. First step: Remove `rEFInd`, and any remains from a previous attempt:
`rEFInd` must be removed prior to the Ubuntu installation according to @japhwil's *recipe*. Let's first verify where `rEFInd` is located: 

```bash
$ sudo diskutil mount disk0s1 
$ $ ls -l /Volumes/EFI/EFI
total 4
drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff   512 Apr  4 21:30 APPLE
drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff  1024 Mar 18 04:23 refind
drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff   512 Mar 18 04:23 tools
```

***As an aside:*** On this (first) effort, we'll follow @japhwil's *recipe* strictly, and remove `rEFInd`, but we note that `rEFInd` seems to have been bypassed in a *boot coup*  by Apple during a recent update. One wonders then if it is actually necessary to remove `rEFInd` under this circumstance, but we'll leave that as an open question for now.

Instructions, advice and other information on removal of `rEFInd` are provided by:

- [this answer on SE](https://superuser.com/a/1139054) 
- [the `rEFInd` author's instructions](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#uninstalling) 

After consulting these sources, we should **verify** that this is actually the true location of the `rEFInd` install by confirming that the file `refind.conf` is located there: 

```bash
$ ls -l /Volumes/EFI/EFI/refind
total 524
-rwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff     140 Mar 18 04:23 BOOT.CSV
drwxrwxrwx@ 1 jmoore  staff   12800 Mar 18 04:23 icons
drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff    2560 Mar 18 04:23 keys
-rwxrwxrwx@ 1 jmoore  staff   31891 Mar 18 04:23 refind.conf
-rwxrwxrwx@ 1 jmoore  staff  219720 Mar 18 04:23 refind_x64.efi
```

`refind.conf` is present, so it's safe to conclude this is the installation location; i.e. this is where we will (at least temporarily) delete/remove/uninstall `rEFInd`: 

```Â bash
$ cd /Volumes/EFI/EFI
$ $ ls -l
total 4
drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff   512 Apr  4 21:30 APPLE
drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff  1024 Mar 18 04:23 refind
drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff   512 Mar 18 04:23 tools
MacBook-2:EFI jmoore$ sudo rm -R refind
# For some reason, rm ignored -R & demanded confirmation on many files; e.g.:
# override rwxrwxrwx  _unknown/_unknown hidden for refind/icons/._os_linuxmint.png? y
# rm: refind/icons/._os_linuxmint.png: No such file or directory 
$ $ sudo rm -R tools
override rwxrwxrwx  _unknown/_unknown hidden for tools/._gptsync_x64.efi? y
rm: tools/._gptsync_x64.efi: No such file or directory
$ ls -l
total 1
drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff  512 Apr  4 21:30 APPLE
```

Note that the folder `tools` was part of the `rEFInd` installation, and therefore also deleted. And so now `rEFInd` is gone! 



### 4. Second step: [Preparations for installation](https://askubuntu.com/a/1245535/831935) 

- A bootable USB stick prepared previously will be used. It was created from the Ubuntu desktop ISO downloaded from Ubuntu's website, and written to USB using `balenaEtcher`. The Macbook has successfully booted into the "Live" Ubuntu system, and it is therefore a "good" copy. 
- A partition was also previously created, and should be sufficient. This partition is seen above under `diskutil list`, and is labeled: `Microsoft Basic Data OTHEROS`; i.e. a FAT partition of 1.2 TB in size. Checking the contents of this partition: 

   ```bash
   $ ls -la /Volumes/OTHEROS
   total 256
   drwxrwxrwx@ 1 jmoore  staff  32768 Jun  6 19:24 .
   drwxr-xr-x@ 4 root    wheel    128 Jun  6 19:24 ..
   drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff  32768 Jun  6 19:24 .Spotlight-V100
   drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff  32768 Jun  6 19:24 .Trashes
   drwxrwxrwx  1 jmoore  staff  32768 Jun  6 19:24 .fseventsd
   ```

- All hidden files created by macOS. Screenshots of `Disk Utility` and the `Info` tab are included below. Also note that during the re-formatting of `OTHEROS` partition, the scheme `GUID Partition Map` was not an available option. That option seems to be available only when the device is selected in `Disk Utility` - and as shown in the screenshot below, it is set raw the recipe.

And so **Preparations** appear to be complete. 



### 5. Third step: [Boot and Install Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/a/1245535/831935)  

- This Macbook predates Apple's "*innovative*" T2 chip, and so Step 1 is unnecessary. 
- `Shutdown...` Macbook, insert USB w/ Ubuntu ISO, press Power button, immediately press & hold the <kbd>option</kbd> key. 
- Interestingly, two (2) USB icons labeled `EFI boot` are displayed. Select the first & proceed.
- `GNU GRUB` menu appears on screen w/ several choices. The *recipe* says select the `Ubuntu` option, then "launch the Ubuntu installer via terminal", but there are options at the bottom of the screen for command line (`c`) and edit commands (`e`). Since the `c` and `e` options aren't mentioned, we'll simply press <kbd>enter</kbd>. 

  - This launches a process... 'Checking disks', then a GUI with an `Install Ubuntu` option. Followed this for a while, but no command line options were offered. Finally quit the installer & went to the "Live" system. Started terminal in Live system, `man ubiquity` showed no `-b` option. 

- Let's start over with a re-boot: This second effort went exactly as the first, suggesting that no *"opportunities"* were missed in the first attempt. Once again, a terminal was started in the Live system - this time the command `ubiquity -b` was entered. The output from this command appeared to be an error. I left the terminal window open with the apparently *"hung"* command in the terminal, and clicked the `Install` button in the GUI window. 
- The install process proceeded to a surprising, but successful completion! The only *challenge* came during the disk partitioning process, but this was aided by the graphical tool in the installer. I formatted the majority of the 1.25TB FAT32 partition as `ext4`; creating a small `swap` partition, and also created a small FAT32 partition as a *"shared"* area to be accessible from Ubuntu and macOS.
- Shortly thereafter, the installer announced it was finished, and instructed to power down, remove the USB stick and reboot. 



### 6. Fourth step: A Surprise Conclusion

I expected (hoped actually) that when I started the Macbook, and held down the <kbd>option</kbd> key, I would be greeted by the native macOS bootloader, offering two choices: macOS and Linux Ubuntu. I further expected that since the `ubiquity -b` command had not produced the hoped-for results, it may be necessary to remove GRUB from the EFI partition, and install rEFInd (*Confession*: I am not a big fan of GRUB). These were my **expectations**. 

Instead, when the macOS bootloader screen appeared, there was only one option: `Macintosh HD`. My initial disappointment turned to pleasant surprise when, after inspection, I realized that the EFI partition was unchanged (no GRUB)... apparently `ubiquity -b` had somehow worked! 

Installation of rEFInd was completed effortlessly, and I verified success by seeing the `rEFInd` folders in the EFI partition. After another reboot, the `rEFInd` screen appeared as expected. I chose the Linux system, and the new Ubuntu installation booted quickly.



```bash
$ diskutil list
/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk0
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         753.0 GB   disk0s2
   3:       Microsoft Basic Data                         1.1 TB     disk0s3
   4:                 Linux Swap                         10.5 GB    disk0s4
   5:       Microsoft Basic Data SHARED                  68.5 GB    disk0s5

/dev/disk1 (synthesized):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +753.0 GB   disk1
                                 Physical Store disk0s2
   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            372.0 GB   disk1s1
   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 40.1 MB    disk1s2
   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                1.0 GB     disk1s3
   4:                APFS Volume VM                      8.6 GB     disk1s4


```

## Epilogue:
It's now 4Q 2023, over 2 years since I upgraded the macOS in my 12-year-old MacbookPro to Ubuntu Linux. It's still running great.

## Addendum:

### I. Partition Type

Note in the `diskutil list` output above that the partition containing the Linux installation (`disk0s3`) still has a `TYPE` of `Microsoft Basic Data` - the same value/type it had before the installation. This is due, I think, to the fact that this partition was originally formatted as `FAT32`. That label sticks, even though it is now formatted as `ext4`! 

According to @DavidAnderson on StackExchange, this can be left as-is, or it can be changed as follows:

```
Partition 3 is a microsoft type and should be a linux type.
From Ubuntu, open a Terminal window. Press the key combination option-control-T. Ener the command: sudo gdisk /dev/sda
Enter the following commands:
t
3
8300
w
y
Reboot the computer.
```



### II. `rEFInd` Adjustments

There are several adjustments that can be made to `rEFInd` to *personalize* it, and make it resistant to `boot coups`. These are mostly covered on the [`rEFInd` website](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/), and will be covered here once they've been tried.  



## Ruminations and Rumors: 

*Note: I'm adding this nonsensically-named section here because I can't think of anywhere else to put it now.* 

I have a fairly extensive collection of Apple computers (MBP & iMac), and I would like to install Linux on all of them. However, it appears there are some major obstacles in the way - all in the form of Apple proprietary software. Two examples are Apple's SSD technology ([NVMe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express)), and the "T2 chip". Specifically: 

* There is no driver available for the proprietary SSD hardware used in most Macs since about 2015. 
* The T2 chip was designed by Apple to take control of your computer away from you, and put that control in Apple's hands. Shocking? Well yes, of course it is. But true nevertheless: T2 will not allow you to install another OS on your Mac. 

I [read here](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MacBook-Finally-Linux-SSD-RW) recently of a [project to develop an open-source driver for Apple's proprietary SSD](https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux). Turns out it's a bit more ambitious than that. I'm keeping my eye on this GitHub project, and hoping for great things from Dunedan. And if you're following Dunedan, you should also follow [roadrunner2's *gist*](https://gist.github.com/roadrunner2/1289542a748d9a104e7baec6a92f9cd7) *"Linux on MacBook Pro Late 2016 and Mid 2017 (with Touchbar)"*.  Lots of comments & both seem to be making good progress! 

And I should be honest... I'm *coming out of the closet now* : I've concluded that Apple now sucks.
