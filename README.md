# Do Something... Even if It's Wrong! 

`“By seeking and blundering we learn.” 
― Johann Wolfgang von Goethe`

## What _IS_ This Anyway? 

This is my collection - my eclectic collection - of code, how-to's, reminders, hints, memory aids, technical crutches, etc, etc, etc. It's nothing more than that, and may never be useful, helpful or interesting to anyone. I have no grand projects planned, and at present, my only motivation for doing this is as a learning project. That said, any comments or suggestions will be appreciated. And thanks for stopping in :)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/seamusdemora/seamus.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

    Q: Can you also use the GitHubDesktop app?


Let's try a table:

Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3
-------- | -------- | --------

Are allowed and recommended | Are allowed and recommended | Are not allowed


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/seamusdemora/seamus.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
