# Do Something... Even if It's Wrong! 

`“By seeking and blundering we learn.” 
― Johann Wolfgang von Goethe`

## What _IS_ This Anyway? 

This is my collection - my eclectic collection - of code, how-to's, reminders, hints, memory aids, technical crutches, etc, etc, etc. It's nothing more than that, and may never be useful, helpful or interesting to anyone. I have no grand projects planned, and at present, my only motivation for doing this is as a learning project. That said, any comments or suggestions will be appreciated. And thanks for stopping in :)
