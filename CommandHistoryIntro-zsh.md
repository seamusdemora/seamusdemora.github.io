## Using command history in your shell - `zsh`

This is written from the perspective of a *macOS* user; specifically, a *macOS Catalina* (or later) user. Under *macOS Catalina*, Apple changed the default shell from `bash` to `zsh`. However, most of the material here is completely relevant for `bash` users as well. Some of the **semantics** will change, but the **operation** of the shell history is the same for `bash` and `zsh`. 

### What is the command history?

If you open a terminal - for example `Terminal.app` in *macOS* - and you enter a command at the prompt, that command is saved into the ***command history***. In fact, depending upon how command history is configured on your machine, every command you have ever issued could be saved into a command history. Control and maintenance of the command history is a function of the **shell** being used. Different **shells** manage the command history in different ways, though they *also have much in common*. If you switch between shells, your command history will be contained in different memory locations and different files.  

The ***command history*** is useful because we often use the same - or similar - commands repeatedly. These commands may contain long lists of *arguments* and *options* that are highly specific, and often arcane. Considerable time and effort may be invested in getting a particular command "tweaked" to perform a certain function in a very specific way. The utility of a command history will be obvious to anyone after using `rsync` or `ffmpeg` or `git` for a while. 

### How does one begin using `history`? 

The reader is now hopefully motivated, and asking, "How do I access my command history?" As with many things, there are many means to access the command history. Let's start with one of the simplest - `history`. The obligatory man page:

```zsh
% man history
```

unfortunately does not reveal much that is helpful. The `history` command is **built in** to the shell - as are many other commands:

As it turns out, the [`history`](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/history-command) command is useful for **listing** the ***command history***, but not particularly helpful at **finding** the command of interest. Nevertheless, as we shall see, it does come in handy, and it's simple to use. The examples below illustrate some uses for the `history` command. Feel free to try them & return here afterward. 

Simpler still is using the *up* (<kbd>⬆︎</kbd>) and *down* (<kbd>⬇︎</kbd>) arrows on the keyboard to scroll up and down in the ***command history***. This is easily demonstrated in any active terminal window - each press of an up or down arrow button will advance or return one command further into the ***command history*** stack. Like the `history` command, this is useful, but not particularly efficient for older commands (further up in the stack) - or for those using the CLI frequently.

Before discussing other methods for accessing the ***command history***, let's briefly focus on how the shell maintains the ***command history***, and by what means the user may exercise control and express his preferences. 

As mentioned above, the ***command history*** is a function of the shell, and for purposes of this recipe the shell of interest is `zsh` - currently the default shell in macOS. The file **`/etc/zshrc`** contains your machine’s default settings, including a few relevant to the ***command history***. Following are the defaults as of this writing:

   ```zsh
   % less /etc/zshrc   # peruse the default settings for zsh
   ...
   # Save command history
   HISTFILE=${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zsh_history
   HISTSIZE=2000
   SAVEHIST=1000
   ...
   ```

Let's briefly review these variables:

* `HISTSIZE` declares the size of the **session history**; session as in an instance of the shell 
* `SAVEHIST` defines the size of the **history file**  
* `HISTFILE` simply declares the name of the user's history file, and where it's stored. 

Note that the ***command history*** is made up of two separate entities: the **session history** and the **history file**. They are "linked" and inter-operate in the following fashion: 

* when a `zsh` session is closed, the **session history** is *concatenated* to the **history file** 
* when the **session history** reaches its limit, the *overflow* is *concatenated* to the **history file** 
* when you go beyond the oldest command in the **session history**, you transition to the **history file**
* the ***command history*** of a new session, before any commands are issued, is entirely from the **history file** 
* commands in the  **session history** are unique to that session; the **history file** contains command history from (potentially) all sessions, past and present.

The following graphic attempts to illustrate some of the relationships between the **session histories** (one per session), and the **history file**:

If you've been using `zsh` for a while, you can open your command history file at `~/.zsh_history` and see what it contains. Likewise, with this file open and in view, the operation and interaction of the **session history** and the  **history file** may be directly observed. (*You may want to temporarily reduce `HISTSIZE` and `SAVEHIST` to save time before doing so. Backing up your .zsh_history` may also be warranted.*)

Given the above, it is left as an exercise for the reader to determine the logic behind Apple's default settings for `HISTSIZE` and `SAVEHIST` in **`/etc/zshrc`**. That is to say, the deep thinking that went into setting `SAVEHIST` to one-half the size of `HISTSIZE`. Extra points to the reader who shares this revelation!  

Some may be tempted to make changes to the default values of `SAVEHIST` and `HISTSIZE`. If you wish to make changes, please note:

   > **NOTE:** When changing values of `HISTSIZE` or `SAVEHIST`, **heed the instructions** in `/etc/zshrc`:
   >
   > **\# Setup user specific overrides for this in ~/.zshrc**
   >
   > At one time, Apple included this warning in `/etc/zshrc`: **Do not make changes in `/etc/zshrc`**

I have yet to see (as of Ventura) Apple include any *practical* history settings in `~/.zshrc`; consequently, you must do this yourself. You should refer to `man zshoptions` (specifically the "History" section) when making these changes. Also note that in `man zshoptions`, it is not always crystal clear whether they are referring to *session history* - or the *history file*.  

With relationships between the ***command history*** *components* made clear, let us explore some additional methods for accessing the ***command history***: 

   1. *up* (<kbd>⬆︎</kbd>) and *down* (<kbd>⬇︎</kbd>) arrows on the keyboard scroll sequentially through the ***command history*** 
      2. the `history` command and its options will list selected commands
      3. <kbd>control</kbd><kbd>r</kbd> at the command prompt will search & match items in your ***command history***  
      4. `!!` runs the previous command; e.g. `sudo !!`  executes the previous command with `root` privileges

These tools, coupled with an understanding of the command history components and how they interact is enough to begin using the ***command history*** productively. A few examples follow with more details.

### Examples for accessing ***command history***

#### 1. <kbd>control</kbd><kbd>r</kbd>

Enter <kbd>control</kbd><kbd>r</kbd> at the command line to see the `bck-i-search:` prompt for a search term:

```zsh
% 
bck-i-search: _
```

Assume you need to find the command for an `ssh` connection; enter `ssh` as the search term:

```zsh
% ssh seamus@macbuntupro.local   # <-- a finding from command history
bck-i-search: ssh_ 
```

This is the *most recent* entry in the ***command history***. If this is NOT the host/command you're searching for, simply enter  <kbd>control</kbd><kbd>r</kbd> again to go to the next previous command. Continue <kbd>control</kbd><kbd>r</kbd> until the command/host of interest is found. When found, use the *right arrow* (<kbd>➡︎</kbd>) to select that command and end the search. This will place the selected command on the command line where it may be edited or executed (<kbd>return</kbd>). Use <kbd>control</kbd><kbd>g</kbd> to terminate the search & return to a blank command line. 

#### 2. `history` command 

Simply running the command `history` from the CLI lists the 16 most recent commands in the ***command history***. No idea why `16` is the *"magic number"* here... If you know the location of a particular command in the ***command history***, that may be specified as an argument. This is rarely useful, except perhaps to list *all* commands; i.e. `history 1` - or more likely `history 1 | less`. Perhaps slightly more useful is piping the entire `history 1` output to `grep`: 

```zsh
% history 1 | grep ssh 

# --OR--

% history 1 | grep ssh | less
```



These are only two examples. The REFERENCES below may provide more advanced methods for searching the ***command history*** more efficiently.

<!---  HIDDEN SHIT

Here is what I prefer instead of the defaults. Make it big… real big:

% cat .zshrc  
HISTSIZE=99999  
HISTFILESIZE=999999  
SAVEHIST=$HISTSIZE

You can edit your own `~/.zshrc` file to add in the above 3 lines.

We’re close to having history setup. But, if you run the `history` command by itself, you still only see the last 16 lines. While it is interesting what I did 5 minutes ago, I often want to see what I did 5 weeks ago. I want to see something really old in history and I will follow it with a grep. What did I do to download that repo last month?

% history | grep "git clone"

Ahh, I forgot that I need to add the `1` parameter in order to start from the beginning of history. My command changes to look as follows.

% history 1 | grep "git clone"

I don’t want to always have to type the `1`. The solution is to alias my history command. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file.

alias history="history 1"

Some people don’t like to alias the default behavior of a built-in shell command, so they may shorten to “`hist`” as follows. I create a new command to use called “`hist`” that will always run `history 1`. Instead of the above alias, use the following:

alias hist="history 1"

So my new command for history with a grep becomes:

% hist | grep "git clone"

You now have a shorter and more powerful command than the default “history” command. It’s quicker, easier, and more seductive.
